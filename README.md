I forked Knut Haugen's samples of mongodb java driver.But I found tests of morphia and mungbean have been out of time.
So I got latest version of morphia and rewrite the part of morphia. Of cause you still need to run mongodb locally.
tests of mungbean will be commited soon. 

#####Just cases for studying.
